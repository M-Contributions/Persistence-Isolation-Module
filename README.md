## Preface

Magento framework is a great tool for building e-commerce solutions. It did spring out its version 2 some while ago and with it, its quality
jumped up in a tremendous way. Even so, i wanted to provide certain facilities to developers that make live easier when coding in Magento and
repetitive tasks shows up.

I must say that, and perhaps a disclaimer is lurking around, this is a series of extensions developed under S.O.L.I.D and other OO design principles
so we'd introduce some standardization in the way we develop in Magento since its designers took this way when they decided to walk a better path for the
architecture of the framework. In short, S.O.L.I.D principles and good design practices dwell all over Magento ecosystem.
